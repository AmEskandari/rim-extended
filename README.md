# rim-modified
This is modified verisin of rim: https://github.com/zwt233/RIM. I worked on this paper in the statistical learning course seminar. In the original source code, they just simulated RIM-GCN, in this source code I also programmed source code for RIM-LP. in addition, I write descriptions and comments for better user understanding. The project has received a full score.
